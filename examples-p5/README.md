examples p5
===========

This is the example we wrote with [P5.js](http://p5js.org/). You need a local server to run "site". So just install the Node.js module reload

    npm install reload

then

    cd path/to/Basic-Coding-Crash-Course-II/examples-p5
    reload

Now you should have a server running on [http://localhoast:8080](http://localhoast:8080)  
You can load all the files from there as it was the root of a domain. E.g. the file hello.txt is at [http://localhoast:8080/hello.txt](http://localhoast:8080/hello.txt) or the css is under [http://localhoast:8080/assets/style.css](http://localhoast:8080/assets/style.css). The folder structure is reprsented in URLs now.  

If you add a file called index.html to any folder you can ommit the file name in the URL. This is why [http://localhoast:8080/index.html](http://localhoast:8080/index.html) becomes [http://localhoast:8080/](http://localhoast:8080/).  

Write your P5.js code into sketch.js and look into the [reference of P5.js](http://p5js.org/reference/) for what you can do.
